=======

1. Corrupt.Rdata is the data file.

2. Corruption_EDA.pdf is the lab 1 assignment file.

3. Ansjory_Han_Queiroz_lab1.Rmd is the R source file. Please update to your root directory:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir='~/Documents/UC Berkeley MIDS/Summer 2018/DATASCI W203/Lab_1/Corruption_EDA')
```

4. Ansjory_Han_Queiroz_lab1.pdf is the R Markdown report. I keep all the existing instructions in place for now. Will remove them after we complete our EDA analysis.
